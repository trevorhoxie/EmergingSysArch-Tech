1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   The purpose of this project was to create a working thermostat that could change states from hot to cold to off and so on. It also had to have the functionality to increase and decrease the target temperature
   and visually indicate with LEDs which state it is currently in. For instance, if the thermostat is in the heating state, it will indicate with a red LED.
3. What did you do particularly well?
   One thing I feel I did particularly well with this project is being able to track where the connections on the breadboard were going for each component. In the examples provided, the breadboard was almost always numbered
   differently than my breadboard, so it took a lot of rearranging wires to get the correct placement.
5. Where could you improve?
   One area I could improve was being more particular about testing my code as I was going through it. Since the code we had to write was minimal for this project, I had a tendency to write it all and then run my program
   which would result in a few bugs that I would need to search out rather than one or two every time I tested the code.
7. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
   One of the main tools I'll be adding to my support network is the ubuntu tutorials that helped with a lot of different issues I ran into while trying to run another computer through Secure Shell, such as creating a network
   folder so that I could have an easier time transferring my files from the host computer to my desktop.
9. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
   My main takeaway from this class was learing how to incorporate hardware into my code in order to create a system.
11. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    This project was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable through frequent comments and the use of object oriented programming to make it easy to edit the code.
